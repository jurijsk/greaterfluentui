# Greater FluentUI Design System
True to Figma's approach implementation of Microsoft's Fluent UI Design System for Web.

## Why anyone needs to rework official Fluent UI component library for Figma?

Here are two purposes to rework the official library, which is very good on its own. 
First, implement the library in a true Figma way, using updates auto-layout and variants, and as of now interactive components. Plus, keep it up to date with Figma Way.
The second purpose is to align it closer to align the Design System with the actual implementation of [`fluentui`](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui) library. Same components names, correct mapping to semantic color palette where possible, and extended palette where it is not possible.
